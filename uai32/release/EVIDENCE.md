# Evidence and provenance

## Frozen implementation

- Repository: [https://github.com/jonny5isalive5/aichat](https://github.com/jonny5isalive5/aichat).
- Candidate: [PR #2](https://github.com/jonny5isalive5/aichat/pull/2); its head was confirmed as `3e924e600ef6b65eff9f00668cb283b259930049` during preparation.
- Audit target: [exact commit](https://github.com/jonny5isalive5/aichat/commit/3e924e600ef6b65eff9f00668cb283b259930049). Branch names and PR heads can move; the SHA is authoritative.
- This release overlay adds documentation, licensing and evidence copies. A later documentation commit is
  not the audited SHA. The original README and sources are preserved inside the audit archive.

## Original audit record

The [unaltered results JSON](evidence/audit-3e924e6-results.json) reports **PASS** for the two remaining
P2 findings and the existing release gates, with no new material defects in that focused scope.
The audit used isolated detached checkouts with no source repairs, commits, pushes or remote mutations.
It was an AI-assisted independent checking pass, not a third-party laboratory certification.

Download the [original evidence ZIP](evidence/audit-3e924e6-evidence.zip), then verify it against the
[original checksum file](evidence/audit-3e924e6-evidence.sha256):

```sh
cd release/evidence
sha256sum -c audit-3e924e6-evidence.sha256
```

Archive SHA-256: `110fd5fa62c87d4324d0a71111aeb4f4d0f23406f7982dcc34663eefd268c734`.
It contains 49 entries: audit summary, execution logs, probe harnesses, toolchain package records,
source snapshots and the committed executable, models and checksum manifest.
Paths in historical logs/harnesses describe the auditor's original scratch environment.
They are provenance, not portable installation instructions; use [REPRODUCE.md](REPRODUCE.md).

| Recorded result | Evidence inside the ZIP |
|---|---|
| 28/28 mandatory checks under the pinned build | `logs/audit3-pinned-verify.log` |
| 18 regression groups; 222 recorded subprocess invocations; 92 sanitizer invocations | `logs/audit3-regressions.log`, `results/regression-results.json`, `audit-summary.json` |
| Committed MNIST pair: 9,781/10,000, loss 0.0766 | `logs/audit3-committed-score.log` |
| Byte-identical executable, four models and manifest; clean checkout | `harness/audit3-pinned-release-results.json`, `logs/audit3-pinned-dist.log` |
| Overflow rejects ±3e38; ±1.7e38 control succeeds | `results/focused-audit-results.json` |
| Final publication rename failure restores the preceding distribution | `results/focused-audit-results.json`, `harness/audit3-focused-probes.py` |
| Compiler/linker/libc package URLs, hashes and sizes | `toolchain/package-records.json`, `toolchain/linker-libc-package-records.json` |

The 222 figure counts recorded invocations from that run; it is not a promised fixed count of every
future run. PASS describes observed behavior within the audit scope, not proof that no defect exists.

## Artifact identity

These are the bytes committed at the audited SHA. Check `dist/SHA256SUMS` from inside `dist/` before
running or rebuilding. The manifest itself is hashed here to bind its identity as well.

| File | Bytes | SHA-256 |
|---|---:|---|
| `dist/uai32` | 9,188 | `996d73cba9676e8932206b9c80493becde6d04b6a57b70839999b0824c0186cb` |
| `dist/iris.model` | 174 | `2a859cf4edba8af4de4fa0a598dfc26280c3ecb914d298260c8846de1671fb48` |
| `dist/mnist14.model` | 21,468 | `24092e4006782550ac02a355d8e4d6bd24eb272a94993152fc159467cfc80c80` |
| `dist/rings.model` | 222 | `7e12bcb541bc8ce39117437458bbd40306f562722a668904fc03cb903b7fc834` |
| `dist/spirals.model` | 348 | `d9a5b4228c59479837c2c77f91a19e0ce7cb9c19561e4ff8f136e69c46bfbb82` |
| `dist/SHA256SUMS` | 387 | `036f3894d7155b71c5c46acafbceb5eac411979d3305a83f9f73ce85f39d75a9` |

The exact reproduction used GCC 13.3, binutils 2.42, and glibc 2.39 headers/startup objects, running
on the audit host with glibc 2.43. A GCC 15.2 / binutils 2.46 / glibc 2.43 native build was **9,140 bytes**
and passed its gates but is a different executable. Its hash in publication-failure probe records must
not be substituted for the **9,188-byte committed executable** identified above.

## What remains open

The archive is preserved evidence, not a hermetic build environment. Runtime libraries and every host
tool are not bundled. The existing numerical reference check covers inference and one SGD step above
bfloat16 rounding noise, not a formal proof of the complete program. Test coverage and source-hash checks
cannot prove the absence of hidden defects or historical benchmark tuning. These are challenge targets.
